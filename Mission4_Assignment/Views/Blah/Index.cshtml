<!-- Paragraph on waht I hope to get out of IS 413 -->
<p>
    I really hope that I gain some valuable coding experience,
    but mostly I really hope that I get to have fun putting these
    skills to memory.  I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on coding concepts,
    but I feel that I sometimes I have to rely on videos to recall things.
    So, I'm trying really hard on this assignment to do what I can remember first,
    then go back and check the practice program I made.
